# Reviewers Project 

This project is based on a day in the life of a data analyst in which he covers the different aspects, such as interacting with your boss on the tasks that need to be worked on, obtaining the desired data from your coworkers, and using code to derive a solution. 

He completed the project on Deepnote, in which one can use different languages in a single workspace like Python and SQL. The majority of these perks are behind payment plans, therefore I completed the project entirely in Python and SQL. The Python file was completed on VS code, whereas SQL was completed on Deepnote, both showing the desired output, and the histograms to show the top reviewers. 

The main purpose behind the project is to show the mindset of a data analyst since the construction of the final project that we will submit relies on us. Showing which data to include in the final report is crucial to show the message that we want to convey. 




The Excel files can be seen in the description of the video since the size is too big to include here.

The SQL file had issues when downloading the file, so one may view my SQL file here, : https://deepnote.com/workspace/study-913f-fa8a644e-2777-4963-94d1-f63d9436864d/project/Real-World-Problem-Data-Analyst-a4a2cca1-2900-423e-9c98-2d83e24d256c/notebook/final_notebook-0a10c403bdc847769058ec3d3ff296a8 but one may need to create a account first, to view.
